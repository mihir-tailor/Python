This Python script uses the turtle graphics library to create a vibrant, colorful spiral pattern against a black background. 

The turtle moves in a loop, selecting a color from a preset list of six (yellow, red, blue, green, purple, and orange), and gradually expanding its path while turning at a 61-degree angle. 

The result is a mesmerizing spiral pattern with dynamic, bright colors. The script runs at maximum speed and completes once the loop reaches 200 iterations.

*  Utilizes Python's turtle library for graphics.Displays a multi-colored spiral pattern.
*  Background set to black for contrast.
*  Ideal for learning and experimenting with turtle graphics, loops, and color selection.
